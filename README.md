# TimeSync - Smart Scheduling App

TimeSync is a modern scheduling application similar to when2meet, but with enhanced timezone awareness and improved usability. The app automatically detects each user's device timezone to ensure accurate scheduling across different time zones.

## Features

- **Timezone-Aware Scheduling**: Automatically detects and displays times in each user's local timezone
- **Flexible Day Selection**: Choose specific days of the week (Sunday through Saturday)
- **15-Minute Time Increments**: Schedule with precision using 15-minute time slots from 12:00 AM to 11:45 PM
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enter your name and easily mark your availability by clicking time slots
- **Visual Availability Grid**: See at a glance who's available when with color-coded indicators
- **Easy Sharing**: Share polls via URL for seamless collaboration
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

1. **Create a Poll**: Set a title, select the days you want to schedule, and choose your time range
2. **Share with Others**: Send the generated URL to participants
3. **Mark Availability**: Each person enters their name and clicks on their available time slots
4. **View Results**: See everyone's availability in an easy-to-read grid format

## Timezone Example

If you're in Pacific Time and mark yourself available at 12:00 PM PST, when you share the poll with friends on the East Coast, they'll see that same time slot displayed as 3:00 PM EST in their local timezone. This ensures everyone sees times in their own timezone while maintaining scheduling accuracy.
