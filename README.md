# time_sync
This app works simialr to when2meet, but it goes based on the users's device time zone to schedule.
for example, if I wanted to send a avalilty poll to my friends I would slect ewhat days (sun, mon, ....fri, sat) and what times (12:00 AM - 11:45 PM) in 15 min increments
if I am on the pacific time zonem I can fill out my vaiblity for my times (say 12:00 PM), but then wehn I send it to my friends on the east coast, it auto updates the time zone so 12 PST to them would look like 3:00 EST.

I would like it so you wring your name and update the time from there
very simialr to when to meet but updated for usability
